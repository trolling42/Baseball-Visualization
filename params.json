Using this visualization tool, we have uncovered some important correlations in the history baseball by analyzing the players performance, U.S. statewide statistics and the performance of the teams in the American and National leagues. We have also shown how significant events in the history of baseball have had an impact on the game and on the different leagues. It is easy to navigate the homepage and find the visualization tools that we have built. We have also embedded a link for GitHub for ease of navigation to the source code from the homepage.
